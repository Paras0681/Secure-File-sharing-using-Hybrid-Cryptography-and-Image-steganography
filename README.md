# Secure-File-sharing-using-Hybrid-Cryptography-and-Image-steganography
In our system, we share the data by encrypting it using Hybrid cryptography as a key factor of our syste m and then  sharing our secret data using image steganography which works as a cherry on top. So even if the hacker is trying to steal our data, he/she  wonâ€™t be able to know what we are trying to share because of the use of Hybrid cryptography. We have used 3 algorithms which are AES,  3DES, Blowfish in our proposed system to encrypt the data into a compressed file and that file is kept hidden in our image using image  steganography.
